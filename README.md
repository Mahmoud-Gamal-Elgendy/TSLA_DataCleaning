# TSLA Data Cleaning Project 


## Project Decription
This project focuses on conducting data analysis and visualization of TSLA (Tesla, Inc.) stock data using Python. The primary goal is to provide insights into the historical performance of TSLA stock over the last five years, identify patterns, and visualize the data distribution. The project utilizes Python libraries such as yfinance and seaborn for fetching and analyzing the stock data.


## Project Features

 Data Retrieval and Storage:
          Fetch the TSLA stock data for the last five years using the yfinance library.
          Store the acquired data in a DataFrame for ease of manipulation and analysis.

  Data Representation:

          Utilize the seaborn library to create a histogram using the histplot function.
          Visualize the distribution of TSLA stock data, providing an overview of the frequency of closing prices over the specified period.

  Outlier Identification and Removal:
      
          Identify and remove outlier values from the "Close" column to refine the data.
          Display the refined data distribution without outliers, allowing for a clearer representation of the underlying patterns.
